# How to use

- make release to compile sources in release mode, binary files on bin/release/client and bin/release/server
- make debug to compile sources in debug mode, binary files on bin/debug/client and bin/debug/server
- make force to force rebuild from sources for both debug and release.
- make clean to clear bin and obj files.

- ./kill_server.sh used to kill daemon server running and cleaning log files and pipe folders.

## server
### the output of server is for information purpose only

- server can be launched with "dem" argument : 'bin/release/server dem', log file at "/tmp/chat.log/srv_dem.log"
  - log file name can be provided as optional argument : log file on folder "/tmp/chat.log/"
  
## client
- no args 
### Command protocol
  - Command list :
    - /who : "List of connected users : nickname and pid"
    - /nick $nickname : "Change my nickname"
    - /msg $pid $message : "To send message to specific pid"
    
## both 
- if client is started with no server running, one server is started in background as daemon.
- server stop when the last client leave.
- dynamic message size, dynamic client list
